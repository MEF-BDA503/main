The course is active since 2016. There is a dedicated course webpage since 2017 (see the archive).\nBDA 503’s main objective is to teach data analytics at a fundamental level. Implementation stands on three core principles: Analysis, Communication and Reproducibility. The course is designed to teach all these skills to students at a limited time.\nThere is no prerequisite of any kind, even prior coding experience. Students of this course come from all sorts of backgrounds. My personal opinion is those who work with Excel frequently, benefit from the course the most.\nMain language of the course is English.
